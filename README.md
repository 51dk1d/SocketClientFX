# SocketClientFX

SocketClientFX is a simple JavaFX 2.x based UI application (generated with FXML) representing the client end of a socket
connection.  Used in conjunction with the SocketServerFX application, these two show how data is passed between sockets.

This application has a dependency on the com.jtconnors.socket project which can be downloaded from via git from:
https://github.com/jtconnors/com.jtconnors.socket.git
