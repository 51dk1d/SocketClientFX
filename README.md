# SocketClientFX

SocketClientFX is a simple JavaFX 2.x based UI application (generated with
FXML) representing the client end of a socket connection.  Used in conjunction
with the SocketServerFX application, these two show how data is passed
between sockets.

**** NOTE: This application has a dependency on the com.jtconnors.socket
project which can be downloaded from via git from:
https://github.com/jtconnors/com.jtconnors.socket.git
